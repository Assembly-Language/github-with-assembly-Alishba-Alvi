remarks about sum-even:
In this assembly language program,My aim was summation of all the even values from an array. For that purpose, I have used test command and conditional loops and jumps.The conditional loop will be terminated only when we have traversed the whole array and the conditional jump is utilized to skip the part of code and move to other if the number in array is not even.The number of even values in array are counted as well.

remarks about sum-odd:
In this assembly language program,My aim was summation of all the Odd values from an array. For that purpose, I have used test command and conditional loops and jumps.The conditional loop will be terminated only when we have traversed the whole array and the conditional jump is utilized to skip the part of code and move to other if the number in array is not Odd.The number of odd values in array are counted as well

remarks about sum-pos:
In this assembly language program,we have performed summation on all the positive numbers of array using conditional jumps and loop and test command and the number of positive values in array are counted as well.


Overall remarks:
In a nutshell, these assembly programs focused on the use of conditional jumps and loops and test command for performing various tasks like summation of even values, odd values and positive values of array.
